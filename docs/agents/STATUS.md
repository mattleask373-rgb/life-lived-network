# Agent System Status — 2026-10-07 (control-tower reconciliation)

## SOURCE OF TRUTH

Repository evidence on `main`, GitHub Actions, open PRs, and canonical contracts are authoritative.
No autonomous production merge/deploy is active.

## CURRENT QUEUE

### P0 / HUMAN-GATED CONTROL PLANE
- **Persistent autonomous executor:** MISSING. The repository contains provider-neutral orchestration and lease/fencing contracts, but no evidence yet proves a durable authenticated executor loop.
- **PR #61 — provider-neutral orchestration:** open; formatting fixes and lockfile reconciliation have been pushed. Fresh Verify is required.
- **PR #62 — claim/lease/heartbeat:** open; formatting fixes and lockfile reconciliation have been pushed. Its lifecycle contract still requires reconciliation with durable `agent_tasks.status` and expiry/fencing semantics before integration.
- **PR #64 — lease fencing / provider authorization hardening:** open; package/lockfile reconciliation pushed. Known security gates remain: authenticated owner/run binding, approval_id-bound human integration, tenant/project scoping, and live Supabase migration/RLS verification.
- **No production execution authority, autonomous merge, or deploy authority is enabled by this status file.**
- **#74 — CONTROL-PLANE-01:** open human-gated follow-up for the missing/proven durable persistence boundary, authenticated fencing and RLS reconciliation.

### AI-NATIVE PROGRAMME
- **PR #67 — ProgrammeState:** open; implementation is green on its prior head, but the current hosted Verify surface must be rechecked after branch/base reconciliation.
- **PR #69 — Experiment Engine:** open draft; current head contains formatting/syntax fixes. Hosted Verify currently fails before lint/test/build on frozen-lockfile reconciliation in the PR merge context; no green claim until a fresh run passes.
- **PR #72 — lockfile reconciliation:** open draft; one-line manifest fix to align `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` with the lockfile. Human action remains required; not merged.
- **PR #73 — accepted experiment → bounded task adapter:** open draft; intentionally no execution/persistence/provider authority.

### PRODUCT / REAL-WORLD SURFACE
- **Canonical supply engine:** REAL and live on main. `src/lib/supply-engine.ts` contains the real deterministic `findSupply()` implementation and regression tests. It is the sole possibility/discovery authority.
- **Ingestion architecture:** `src/lib/ingest/*` remains the canonical provider-neutral boundary. PR #49 is the reconciliation anchor; PR #43's parallel `external-world.ts` path must be absorbed/retired before integration.
- **Map/locality:** PR #54 visual language, #57 map-first locality integration, #60 sparse-locality progressive disclosure remain human-gated. #57 depends on #54; #58 depends on #49.
- **Journey trust:** PR #59 hardens stale/cancelled journey eligibility and remains human-gated.
- **Search context:** PR #52 preserves search intent into canonical locality discovery without creating a second matcher.

## VERIFIED CURRENT FINDINGS

- Main no longer has the historical supply-engine stub; the canonical implementation and tests are present.
- No second matcher/ranker/discovery engine is authorized.
- Unknown/absence remains distinct from real-world absence.
- No fabricated inventory, availability, demand, learner capability, or external-world activity is permitted.
- Human gates remain required for production autonomy, security/RLS/privacy, irreversible semantics, external side effects, legal/commercial consequences, and consequential learner decisions.

## CI / DRIFT

- PR #61 latest failed Verify because lint ran and reported formatting-only Prettier errors; those files have now been formatted. A subsequent run must also clear the frozen-lockfile mismatch.
- PR #62 latest failed Verify on formatting-only Prettier errors; those files have now been formatted. No new Verify result is yet evidenced.
- PR #64 latest Verify failed at `bun install --frozen-lockfile`; its branch declared `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` 2.25.x while the lockfile resolves 2.26.0. Manifest reconciliation has been pushed.
- PR #67 latest observed Verify failed at frozen-lockfile because its branch manifest still differed from the lockfile in the hosted merge context. This is a CI/base-drift issue, not a ProgrammeState behaviour failure.
- PR #69 latest observed Verify failed at frozen-lockfile in the hosted PR merge context. The head manifest already declares 2.26.0; fresh hosted verification is required to determine whether the merge ref still inherits a stale manifest/lock combination.
- PR #72 Verify is green on its exact head, but the fix is not merged.
- Product PRs #54/#43/#49 are based on an older main lineage; #52/#57/#58 are intentionally dependent/diverged. Do not flatten those dependencies without review.

## NEXT

1. Re-run/observe fresh Verify on #61/#62/#64 after formatting + manifest reconciliation; diagnose only remaining behavioural/security failures.
2. Reconcile #62's lifecycle model with the durable SQL status contract and authenticated fencing boundaries before any integration.
3. Reconcile #43 into #49's canonical ingest boundary; preserve useful fixture/normalization/freshness/provenance evidence while retiring the parallel architecture.
4. Keep #72, #69, #67, #73 and all control-plane work human-gated; no merge performed by the control tower.


## Work opportunity contract — 2026-10-19 (review pending)

- Added an optional typed `WorldEntry.workOpportunity` contract for short-term, seasonal, longer-term and professional arrangements. It keeps integer minor-unit pay plus currency/basis; separately classifies paid work, volunteering, skills exchange, unpaid training and unstated engagement; and carries duration, dates, accommodation, transport notes, stated skill requirements, host expectations, conditions, jurisdiction, provenance/rights, policy review and publication state.
- Runtime parsing is pure and IO-free. Public classification requires a published record, explicit engagement type, cleared rights and human-approved jurisdiction-policy review. Missing pay remains `not_stated`, never volunteering; the schema does not decide employment status.
- Extended the shared taxonomy for hospitality shifts, event work, seasonal work, short-term work and longer-term/professional roles. Existing cleaning, gardening and odd-job categories are reused, not duplicated. Only publishable non-demonstration work records classify under the new work group.
- **Scope limit:** this is a domain/taxonomy contract, not database persistence, partner activation, or an end-to-end opportunity UI. Existing canonical `findSupply()` remains the only discovery authority. No migrations, production writes or external feeds are enabled.
- Australian Fair Work review remains a human/legal gate; the Fair Work Ombudsman notes that labelling an arrangement volunteering does not settle whether an employment relationship exists: https://www.fairwork.gov.au/starting-employment/unpaid-work
- Local and hosted verification must be attached to the final PR head before approval; this connector session has no local shell.
